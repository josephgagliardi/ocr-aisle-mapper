# Laravel Grocery Aisle Item Mapping application

Built using VM fork of the original Laravel Homestead aimed at simplication [here](http://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-get-homestead-vagrant-vm-running/).

Leverages Tesseract for OCR (Optical Character Recognition), Twig for templating, Nginx for nginxy stuff

Builds on the ideas by Lukas White in [this article](https://www.sitepoint.com/ocr-in-php-read-text-from-images-with-tesseract/)
